								<p> Hello and welcome! This vault of mine is a platform I made that houses my hidden passions for writing, world building, and traditional art. It also shines a light on those who have helped me along the way in my writing journey as a new author. </p>
								<p> If you have seen this website before, it went through a massive overhaul. I realized that it had a little too much of everything, and therefore wasn't concentrated in a way I would have liked. I do hope that now, anyone entering my vault will not be overwhelmed by the magnitude of the site and more easily navigate through my wares. </p>
								<p> "Having too many options is the same as having none." <p>
								<p> This website will now be more easily updated overtime to include more content. </p>
								<p> Tell your friends, tell your family, and catch my social media (especially twitter) from time to time for updates as I plan to have something posted as regularly as I can. </p>
								
								<p> If you wish to support me more directly, you can access my <a href="patreon.com/SarkahnAM">patreon page</a> </p>
								
								<p> Please look forward for more to enter the vault! My author page can be found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/author/sarkahn_am">here</a> and my Medium page <a href="https://medium.com/@alexandredmurray/about">here</a>. Enjoy. </p>

									<p> All of my blog content can be found on Medium by using the button below!</p>
									<p> As a Game Master, my starting point was learning how to world build using the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Dungeon-Rulebook-Roleplaying/dp/0786965622/ref=sr_1_15?crid=3QPP9JNRO4HKQ&amp;keywords=D%2526D&amp;qid=1681223345&amp;sprefix=d%2526d%252Caps%252C204&amp;sr=8-15&amp;th=1&_encoding=UTF8&tag=sarkahnsvault-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=7a77801518c2cb8a838842f6d93ed888&camp=1789&creative=9325">Dungeon Master Guide</a>!</p>
									<p> This was my starting point into writing, world building and learning how to be an effective Game Master! If I could do it all over again, I would do the same thing without hesitation.</p>
									<p> I want as many people to enjoy the worlds they create for games, books and everything in between so I will do my best to publish some articles about what I did multiple times a week. A difficult task but one I plan to accomplish.</p>

I want to give back as much as I can with what I create from those that support me directly.</p>
