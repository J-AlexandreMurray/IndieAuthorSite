								<p> Hello and welcome! This vault of mine stores my hidden passions for world building, traditional art and the art of writing(the basis of literature). It also shines a light on those who have helped me along the way in my writing journey as a new author. </p>
								<p> If you have seen this website before, it went through a massive overhaul. I realized that it had a little too much of everything, and therefore wasn't concentrated in a way I would have liked. I do hope that now, anyone entering my vault will not be overwhelmed by the magnitude of the site and more easily navigate through my wares. </p>
								<p> "Having too many options is the same as having none." <p>
								<p> This website will now be more easily updated overtime to include more content. </p>
								<p> Tell your friends, tell your family, and catch my social media from time to time for updates as I plan to have something posted as regularly as I can. </p>
								<p> Please look forward for more to enter the vault. My author page can be found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/author/sarkahn_am">here</a> and my Medium page <a href="https://medium.com/@alexandredmurray/about">here</a>. Enjoy. </p>

							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major"> About Me </h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> I am Sarkahn A.M. (yes, this is my pen name and online presence). A short fiction indie author; and this website is a platform used to expose my literary art, as well as the art of others, with the world. </p>
								<p> I love story telling. Rekindling my love for fantasy and creation had an incredible effect on me in 2020, and now I wish to listen to these passions whispering in my ear. I am a new writer and would love for others to enjoy reading the stories I put together. </p>
								<p> What drew me back into writing was the role playing game of "Dungeons and Dragons", however, the hook was my new role as the Dungeon Master. All of the work involving creating a world, characters, plot, setting, and experiences, pulled me so hard into the void of fiction that I never want to leave again. The experience and process is so much fun I cannot help but talk about it to exhuastive lengths (I am sorry to those of you I bored to death about it). </p>
								<p> Due to the pandemic and life in general, nothing is quite the same. My passion for writing simply built up inside of me, yet I had no way to release it through Dungeons and Dragons due to time constraints and..well, life. So, I decided to write about everything. The characters my players control, and characters within the world I created. What must be understood is that, this is only the beginning and it is NOT Dungeons and Dragons content. It may seem to be a hobby now, but it is a genuine passion, and I have a lot that I am working on that span across many different genres like literary rpg, romance, and sci-fi. </p>
								<p> I feel most comfortable writing short and novelette lengh stories. Though short in length, they allow me to increase the flexibility of the story and provide everyone with a book in their hand much faster than a single novel. Though, I may combine books together into novel length books at some point later down the line. </p>
								<p> Please look forward to my debut Short read "Arcane Thief" which is out now on Amazon in both paperback and e-book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQJRSPH3">here</a>! My new fantasy novella "Equivalent Exchange" will be preorder soon! </p>
